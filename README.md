Tic tac toe game made in Python, with convolutional neural networks. Speech commands datasets taken from [Tensorflow database](http://download.tensorflow.org/data/speech_commands_v0.01.tar.gz). Dataset was divided into smaller sets in order to create model that will recognize words in English.
Application recognizes 6 keywords:
- left
- right
- up
- down
- stop
- go.

Interface made with [PyGame](https://www.pygame.org/docs/). Neural Network made with  [Keras](https://keras.io/api/). Sound processing with [Librosa](https://librosa.org/doc/latest/index.html).

Todo list:
- [x] Visual cue that move was made 
- [ ] Ability to play versus AI
- [ ] Add sound effects
- [ ] Work on prettier UI
